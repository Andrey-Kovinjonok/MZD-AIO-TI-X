<p><strong>I do not know how to use this tool! :(</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Download the latest AIO version, unzip the file and start <strong>‘choose.cmd’</strong><br />
   You have to press on keyboard <strong>“A”</strong> to <strong>“Z”</strong> and <strong>“4”</strong> to <strong>“6”</strong> for choosing tweaks and again for unchoosing.<br />
   <strong>“9”</strong> for help, <strong>“1”</strong> and <strong>“2”</strong> for switching between installation and uninstallation mode (AIO starts in installation mode),<br />
   <strong>“8”</strong> to choose all tweaks and at end <strong>“0”</strong> to start compilation of selected tweaks.<br />
   (It’s still a DOS batch, so no mouse, except for help window (“9”), here you can use cursor and mouse.)</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>Is AIO compatible with my FW version?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please look into the <em><strong>README</strong></em> (section “WHICH FW VERSIONS ARE SUPPORTED”), all compatible FW versions are listed there.<br />
   But AIO will read out your FW version at beginning of installation and show if it’s not compatible (or not yet tested) and you can abort the installation at this point, if you want.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>How long does it take till the installation starts?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This can take from 30 seconds to 2 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>How long does the installation take?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Up to 8 minutes if every tweak has been selected (especially custom colors and speedcam-patch).</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>How long does the uninstallation take?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Up to 5 minutes if every tweak has been selected.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>Do I have to uninstall a tweak before installing it again?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No, you can reinstall, because during installation, the tweak will be deleted and then installed again.<br />
   You can install every tweak with AIO, you never have to uninstall before.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>Do I have to use same AIO version for uninstalling the tweaks?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No. You can use latest AIO version for that.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>Will all previously installed tweaks automatically uninstalled, if I not choose them for new installer?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No. Only tweaks you have choosen to uninstall will be removed.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>If something goes wrong, how can I help you to help me?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During installation/uninstallation, a log file is created (AIO_log.txt) and some additional files will be copied on the USB drive.<br />
   Please make a ZIP file of them (complete root of USB drive) and send that to me or upload somewhere (e.g. google drive or so) and send me the link.<br />
   You can download <a href="http://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzvvwWSFVeWFUjF2SHNncHZ4ajg" title="copy_files"><strong>this tweak</strong></a> to copy some files from your MZD system to USB drive, that are helpful for me to.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>Why the uninstaller for all tweaks has changed, so that no confirmation is needed anymore and reboot will done automatically at the end?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because of the people who had the problem with stuck at Mazda boot logo.<br />
   If the USB ports are still working, uninstalling was not possible because the confirmation with “OK” could not be executed.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>If I want to go back to original state but I forgot the tweaks I’ve installed, what can I do?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It doesn’t matter, if you choose tweaks for uninstalling, that you haven’t installed.<br />
   If the uninstaller don’t find a backup, it will copy the original files from USB drive over your original files of your MZD system, so nothing has really changed after that.<br />
   <strong>BUT: YOU SHOULD NOT DO THIS FOR NEW AND UNKNOWN FW VERSIONS!</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>How do I make a reboot of the MZD system?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Press NAV+MUTE for 10 seconds.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>Where can I find more background images</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look at \choose\more_background-images</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>Is there a way to change/delete the jukebox-radio picture on the right side where album art would go?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you don’t want to have this, then uninstall blank-album-art-frame, make an installer again and change or delete this file on your USB drive before installing:<br />
   config\blank-album-art-frame\jci\gui\common\images\no_artwork_icon.png</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>I don’t get GPS data after installing speedometer</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This happens with newer FW versions (56.00.51x). Try this to get GPS data for these FW versions too:
  * After opening the doors (or trunk) at least <strong>wait 35 seconds</strong>, then start the engines
  * Before starting the speedometer app, shortly start the NAVI app before (works too, if NAVI app was open if engine was stopped)
  * Unplug and replug the NAV SD card (<strong>should be avoided</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>In entertainment window, pause-on-mute works perfectly. But if you leave from entartainment window, “mute” mutes sound but not pauses song.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This behaviour is correct and as expected. The pause command doesn’t reach the player, if you are in any other app/menu.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>If I take out the SD card and plug it into my computer and run the map updates on the Mazda Toolbox software will it overwrite any of the tweaks or cause issues?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No. But before you can use Mazda Toolbox you have to delete speedcam.txt/speedcam.spdb from SD-card (when you have installed speedcam-patch).<br />
   After updating, you can copy the files again.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>When do i need the swapfile patch. I’ve only one usb stick with music and videos in the car. Do i need this patch then?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You don’t need it, it’s just an option to enhance the video player, if you have problems to play videos.<br />
   But I’m not sure, if it’s really worth it.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>I have a question/problem with speedometer.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please look at <a href="http://github.com/Siutsch/AIO---All-in-one-tweaks/blob/master/speedometer_readme.txt" title="speedometer_readme.txt"><strong>speedometer_readme.txt</strong></a> and <a href="http://github.com/Siutsch/AIO---All-in-one-tweaks/blob/master/speedometer_changelog.txt" title="speedometer_changelog.txt"><strong>speedometer_changelog.txt</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>How can I enable Hotspot on MZD system (I don’t know, if that still works with .51x FW versions):</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Try the following:
   1. Open diagnostics menu (buttons Music + Favorites + Pwr / Mute and hold until menu appears)
   2. Hold down “DEL” until “JCI Test Mode Active” appear at right black box (15-20 sec.).
   3. Press “11” and then press “Enter.”
   4. Select script WiFi AP Toggle (sor so)
   Then the access point of the car is running, you should see a WLAN “cmu …”. Simply log in and then access via IP 192.168.53.1 on the system.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>Can I install AIO even from an SD card?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No. SD card slot in the car is ONLY for satnav maps. You need to use USB port in the car, so either USB stick or USB-SD card reader with your card in it.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>What are the video specs for playing videos?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Video: MP4, AVI, FLV, WMV; Audio: Stereo MPA</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>I can’t play videos. What can I do?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Try the following:
   * unplug all other USB drives, especially one, with much MP3s on it
   * copy only one mp3 on your video USB drive
   * copy only a few videos on your stick (you don’t have to delete, rename to *._mp4 is OK too, so that they will not found anymore)
   * reboot your system and try to play a video right after that
   * close the player and start again
   * it that works, then change the audio input after that</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>Is there anything to note, if I use a MAC?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are using a Mac or Mac formatted thumb drive make sure there are no hidden files on the drive.<br />
   The drive should be formatted Fat 32 on a PC if possible.<br />
   Look here: https://www.reddit.com/r/mazda3/comments/3d5lvr/mazda_infotainment_update/ctls5ef</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>What FW versions are out there?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look at <a href="http://github.com/Siutsch/AIO---All-in-one-tweaks/blob/master/choose/docs/FW%20info.txt" title="choose\docs\FW info.txt"><strong>choose\docs\FW info.txt</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>What is the content of the speedcam.txt file?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look at <a href="http://github.com/Siutsch/AIO---All-in-one-tweaks/blob/master/choose/docs/speedcam_info.txt" title="choose\docs\speedcam_info.txt"><strong>choose\docs\speedcam_info.txt</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>After installing date_to_statusbar mod V2.2 the top bar is full transparent and because of my bright background I can’t read the clock at all. What can I do?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Edit your background to be dark in the top, or you have to change the following png file:
   <code class="highlighter-rouge">sh
   \choose\config_all\date-to-statusbar_mod\jci\gui\common\controls\StatusBar\images\StatusBarBg.png.v2.2
  </code>
   Rename to StatusBarBg.png, change transparency, and rename again to StatusBarBg.png.v2.2. Then install date_to_statusbar mod again.<br />
   If you want to use the original file, then look here:
   <code class="highlighter-rouge">sh
   \choose\config_org_all\date-to-statusbar_mod\jci\gui\common\controls\StatusBar\images\StatusBarBg.png
  </code>
   Copy as StatusBarBg.png.v2.2 to
   <code class="highlighter-rouge">sh
   \choose\config_all\date-to-statusbar_mod\jci\gui\common\controls\StatusBar\images\
  </code>
   and install again</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>I want to change the order of the audio sources. How can I do that?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have to edit<br />
   /jci/gui/apps/system/js/systemApp.js<br />
   line 624 - 637<br />
   <strong>Be careful, in the last line must not be a comma, or you run in to boot loop!</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>I know of the problems, that doing a factory reset after installing Android Auto leads the system to stay at Mazda boot loop logo, there is now AA to choose in new AIO version, but I want to install anyway. How can I do this?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have to take a look into the readme, changelog for V1.48:<br />
   Update of “Android Auto” Headunit App to V0.92B (2016-06-13), <strong>BUT TEMPORARILY NOT VISIBLE FOR INSTALLATION MODE</strong>, because of serious factory reset problems.
   * You can still choose AA with <strong>“r”</strong>, but an installation is currently not recommended!
   * By pressing “8” (select most of the tweaks), Android Auto is first also no longer selected.
   * Added popup message with warning text after choosing AA if you do so nevertheless.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>Why there is a tweak for backup the /jci folder, but no script to restore these files?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s not necessary, because:<br />
   In almost all installation jobs there are backups stored as *.org. These files are used to restore the original state.<br />
   Only if these *.org files are not found then the original files are used, which are also available on the USB stick.<br />
   For apps that require completely new files for installation, like speedometer, Android Auto, castscreen receiver and videoplayer,
   replacing the original files from complete backup of /jci folder would not cause removal of these files.<br />
   And there are many other additional files as markers for color themes, no_more_disclaimer, etc. that would remain in system and not be deleted.<br />
   That only happens, if you use AIO for that.<br />
   So a copy of the entire /jci backup folder would replace 99% of files that were not changed from all the tweaks and this takes a lot of unnecessary time.<br />
   And not all tweaks would be replaced or removed by that precedure.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>How can I join background photos for Background Rotator tweak:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look at: PhotoJoiner.net - http://old.photojoiner.net/<br />
   Press <strong>“Select Photos”</strong> and just choose 10 backgrounds (look at choose\more_background-images to find some).<br />
   Let set “Style” as “Vertical” (upper right corner, is already default) and klick <strong>“Join Photos”</strong>.<br />
   After that your joined graphic is shown, right click on it and select <strong>“Save Image as”</strong> to save.<br />
   Now you only have to convert the *.jpg to *.png (you can use every viewer tool out there, I use <strong>Faststone Image Viewer</strong> for that) and save as background.png in folder<br />
   <code class="highlighter-rouge">sh
   \choose\config_all\BackgroundRotator\jci\gui\common\images  on your USB drive before installing this tweak with AIO.
  </code>
   If you want to have more or less images and adjust the rate of change:<br />
   Rate of change can be changed by editing the value of “animation” (Line:25) in config/BackgroundRotator/common.css<br />
   So, you have to modify line 25:<br />
   <code class="highlighter-rouge">sh
   animation: slide **600**s steps(**10**,end) infinite;
  </code>
   For example, if you want to have 20 different backgrounds and show everyone only for 10 seconds:
   <code class="highlighter-rouge">sh
   animation: slide 200s steps(20,end) infinite;
  </code></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>Can you write this or that tweak for us?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No, I’m only the collector of all the tweaks out there. Although I underestimated the whole project, I had to solve a lot of dependencies and I learned a lot of coding.<br />
   But I’m still miles away from writing and developing a tweak on my own.</p>
