<h3 id="v150---2016-07-22">V1.50 - 2016-07-22</h3>
<p><em><strong>CHANGES/NEWS:</strong></em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Tried to integrate an automatic update function (hope it works on every Windows version out there)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>i use aria2 ( https://aria2.github.io ) for that, so if your firewall complains aria2c.exe, you have to allow it</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>how does this work: file ‘AIO_update.txt’ will be downloaded from google drive, evaluated and if there is an update, a zip file with changes will be downlaoded and unzipped automatically</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>i hope, this will work for version 1.51 …</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After select ‘individual background image’ you now can choose from one of 80 images in choose\more_background-images folder</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>simply double-click on the file-name of the image and it will be used, if you just close the window, the original background will be used</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>if you want to use your own background images, just copy into the folder choose\more_background-images</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>unfortunately I can’t show thumbnails of the images, so an explorer window showing the thumbnails for folder ‘more_background-images’ will be opened automatically</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added color-themes for AIO: set colortheme=1 (old theme) or 2 or 3 (actually set) in line 18 of choose.cmd or change to values by yourself</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seperated changelogs (now CHANGELOG.txt) from AIO_README (now README.txt), *.md files will be renamed to *.txt at first start of AIO</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Language popup window will now be shown only at first start of AIO (and after an update)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Background Rotator should work now</p>

    <ul>
      <li>try this to make your own backgrounds very easy: http://old.photojoiner.net/</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added new FW 58.00.250A- NA (from new CX-9) for all tweaks (thanks to houset from mazda3revolution.com for the necessary files)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>modified installer/uninstaller for speedcam-patch (thanks to Modfreakz), pause_on_mute, no_more_disclaimer, list_loop and order_of_audio_source_list, all other files are the same</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Update to speedometer 4.4:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>added language French (thanks to drean179 and Regg001 from mazda3revolution.com)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>optional show the vehicle speed instead of the gps speed in the small speedometer (thanks to vic_bam85)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>added numeric output of top engine speed in right table</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>changed statusbar speedometer toggling of gps altitude/direction only active if full size app is closed</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Updated all tools by Modfreakz in folder choose\tools\JCI_NNG_Tool</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added Croatian for safety-warning-reverse-camera</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed speedcam-patch installer for 56.00.100A-ADR, 56.00.230A-ADR and 56.00.401A-JP, data.zip wasn’t modified correctly, jci-linux_imx6_volans-release wasn’t copied correctly</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed speedcam-patch uninstaller for 56.00.513C-ADR, I hope the NAV app will start again after uninstalling, please report back</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added 58.00.250A-AN for speedcam-patch (thanks to GrilloA from mazda3revolution.com for the files), please report, if it works</p>

</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="v149---2016-07-02">V1.49 - 2016-07-02</h3>
<p><em><strong>CHANGES/NEWS:</strong></em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Bug for app uninstaller found (AA, speedo, video): problem, if more than one app entry of same app is available (due to bug in old installer), now all entrys should be deleted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modified installer for speedometer, AA and videoplayer. The app menu entries will now be added hopefully, if installed with many other tweaks together too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed installer for swap file. Entries in stage_wify.sh should now be correct. Please uninstall / install again to correct the entries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added “Background Rotator” tweak that makes a small change to common.css to rotate through 10 different backgrounds (thanks to TREZDOG44):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>By changing config/BackgroundRotator/background.png rotate through 10 backgrounds, 1 per minute. (10 backgrounds in a row total: 8000px X 480px)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rate of change can be changed by editing the value of “animation” (Line:25) in config/BackgroundRotator/common.css</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Enter the total time, each background will show for [total time / 10] (Example: 600s/10 Backgrounds = 60 seconds per background)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Update to speedometer 4.3:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Fixed statusbar speedo overlapping with message icon if 4 icons are visible (BT,WIFI,BATTERY,MESSAGE)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Added percentage display of both idle times</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Added semi transparent background for value table</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Removed speedometer background image (you’ll see your own background)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modified installer for speedcam- patch:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Added again ready patched data.zip files for FW versions 56.00.513B- EU and 55.00.760A- NA, because data.zip and jci- linux_imx6_volans- release.org must match</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>data.zip will only be patched directly for FW versions 56.00.100A- ADR, 56.00.230A- ADR and 56.00.401A- JP</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added additional popup window before installation begins if previously unknown or yet untested FW version is detected</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed bug for bigger- album- art uninstaller (thanks to SvePar)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed uninstaller for FuelConsumptionTweak, I hope there is no crash anymore, if opening FuelConsumption page3 (thanks to lory323)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>It seems, that during installation sometimes the backup files (.org) were copied with 0 byte. Now I check for filesize too before renaming back *.org files.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Added this to some other uninstallers too.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second versions of FuelConsumptionTweak: new with MPG (miles per gallon):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You have to rename \choose\config_all\FuelConsumptionTweak\jci\gui\apps\ecoenergy\controls\FuelConsumption\js\FuelConsumptionCtrl.MPG.js to FuelConsumptionCtrl.js</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I started to put together a FAQ. Look at AIO_FAQ.txt (suggestions for content are welcome)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many code optimizations and cleaning (not visible for you), i.e. outsourced most of the help text files in one file</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enabled WIFI for NA FW versions again, I think it was/is not the problem of bricked CMUs after doing a factory reset (still think it must be AA).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>INFO: AA not working anymore with newest google play services V9.2.56, if you have a fully up to date phone, it probably won’t let you use AA.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Use 9.0.83 instead: http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-play-services/google-play-services-9-0-83-release/</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Or: enable developer option by going to Setting/About Phone/Build number (tap 7 times) and now you’re a developer.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You will have to downgrade your google play services, simply go to Setting/App, and then look for Google Play Services and then select Uninstall for all users on the top right corner (there should be a setting indicator with 3 dots on it).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It seems, that this only works with rooted phones.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="v148---2016-06-16">V1.48 - 2016-06-16</h3>
<p><em><strong>CHANGES/NEWS:</strong></em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>IT SEEMS, THAT DOING A FACTORY RESET AFTER INSTALLING AA LEADS THE SYSTEM TO STAY AT MAZDA BOOT LOGO!!!
SO AVOID A FACTORY RESET OR UNINSTALL ALL TWEAKS, AT LEAST AA BEFORE THAT (STILL NOT SURE IF THAT IS SUFFICIENT)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Update of “Android Auto” Headunit App to V0.92B (2016- 06- 13), but temporarily not visible for installation mode, because of serious factory reset problems.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>You can still choose AA with “r”, but an installation is currently not recommended!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>By pressing ‘8’ (select most of the tweaks), Android Auto is first also no longer selected</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Added popup message with warning text after choosing AA if you do so nevertheless</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Deactivated enabling of WIFI for US FW versions in this context for safety too.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>This is done since version 1.47 and could also be the reason for the problems after doing a factory reset (but I don’t think so).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the problems after doing a factory reset (stays at Mazda logo) I changed the installer for SSH_bringback again, will now be installed for all .51x FW versions (now for “ADR” versions too)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Small update for speedometer 4.2 (problems with new trip distance to 20 meter accuracy, only worked for first 10 km)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Changed uninstaller for all tweaks, so that no confirmation is needed anymore and reboot will done automatically at the end</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Removed umount / mount for 56.00.51x FW versions during installation of speedometer, since it was not working anyway
Try this to get GPS data for these FW versions too:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>After opening the doors (or trunk) at least wait 35 seconds, then start the engines (thanks @drletai for this hint)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Unplug and replug the NAV SD card</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Before starting the speedometer app, shortly start the NAVI app before (works too, if NAVI app was open if engine was stopped)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Small update of Frensh translation by user salegosse from mazda3revolution board</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed small bug for bigger album art tweak (installer and uninstaller)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bug for speedcam- patch installer fixed, speedcam.txt was not copied to SD card (only faulty for V1.47)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modified installer/uninstaller for speedometer, speedcam- patch, videoplayer, swap file and some other tweaks, I don’t know anymore.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>I hope installation of speedcam- patch works now always right the first time</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I hope tweaks that appear in app menu will now always entered correctly in every combination of installation / uninstallation</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added more log information to root of USB drive (AIO_log.txt and some files). If you have problems, I need them.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If speedometer was already installed, then color will adjusted anyway, if custom- infotainment- colors will be installed without speedometer again.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If custom- infotainment- colors was already installed (with &gt;= 1.37), then color of speedometer will adjusted anyway, if speedometer will be installed without custom- infotainment- colors.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>this though works only if the installation of custom- infotainment- colors is done with AIO V1.37 and higher (a file marker for detection of installation will set)!</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New installation routine for “list_loop_mod”, can now be installed with or without additional shorter_delay_mod (which generates frequent beeps!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each speed in all speedcam files increased by 5 kmh (you should be annoyed less now)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Changed the language detection a little. I hope it works now. If not, send me first and possibly second line of Window (i.e. Detected CountryCode is xx, which is unknown).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every command is logged to AIO_log.txt for troubleshooting (look at root of USB drive after applying / removing of tweaks).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the beginning it is tested whether mount point of USB drive really works (try to copy a file from MZD to USB drive). If not, system will reboot automatically.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Popup window of detected MZD version before start of installation / removing, with the possibility to still manually cancel at this point (you have to press “OK” to start).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Every selected tweak generates a popup window on MZD System now during installing / removing, so you know exactly at what point it is and how long it takes.</li>
  <li>To get AIO working in simulation, the language folder “01” for english is renamed to “1” and code in choose.cmd was adjusted accordingly, so it should work now.</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>NEWS:</strong></em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>New Speedometer 3.6 with permanent speed + direction in the status bar</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Support for ‘no nav SD’ is missing in V3.6, the compass fix needs some changes to fits to 3.6 code, so it’s coming again for V4.0</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added 8 more images for removing the safety warning label from the reverse camera (french, czech, danish, italian, spanish, dutch, polish, russian)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Translation for Spanish created (with google translator, so sorry to the native Spanish speaking people!) for testing the new manual language switching.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added help- system (press ‘x’ to open), only german and english at this time. Text suggestions welcome! :)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AND FINALLY: rewrote choose.cmd from scratch. No more interview (but also no more funny answers),</p>

    <ul>
      <li>only one page to select all tweaks for installation and deinstallation and manual switching the language (if you want and if already translated).</li>
      <li>Please only start locally, is very slow from a network connection!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>TODO</strong></em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“Android Auto” Headunit App installer get to running</p>
  </li>
  <li>Waiting for Speedometer 4.0 with integration in native app menu (hopefully coming soon, thanks to Herko- ter- Horst!).</li>
  <li>Prepare for additional installation with 56.00.511A (adjustments necessary only for speecam- patch, media- order_patching and pause_on_mute), perhaps then with automatic detection during installation.</li>
</ul>
