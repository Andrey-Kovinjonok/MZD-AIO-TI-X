AIO also contains an original version of each file just in case any of the backup files are missing. In future versions I plan to include an option to copy and store your own system's backup files into AIO as a failsafe to ensure compatability for future CMD versions.\n - In general, for all Compatible CMD versions it is safe to run uninstalls of tweaks that have not been installed BUT keep in mind that AIO will overwrite the files involved with the included failsafe backups because it will not find any available backups in the system.

While compiling, close all folders and documents especially files that are actively being used by MZD-AIO-TI (*ex: '_copy_to_usb'*)\n - Try selcting fewer tweaks at a time, picking too many increases the chaces for an unexpected error. \n - If the installer does not start in the car try reformatting your USB drive as FAT32 and make sure all other USB devices are disconnected.

MZD-AIO-TI will read out your FW version at beginning of installation and show if itâ€™s not compatible (or not yet tested) and you will abort the installation at this point, for saftey.",
    "q2": "How long does it take till the installation starts?",
    "a2": "Tipically installation will start whithin 30 seconds to 2 minutes but it can take up to 10 minutes to begin.",
    "q3": "If something goes wrong, how can I help you to help me?",
    "a3": "During installation/uninstallation, a log file is created (AIO log.txt & MZD-AIO-TI info.txt) and some additional files will be copied on the USB drive.  Please make a ZIP file of them (complete root of USB drive) and send that to me or upload it somewhere (e.g. google drive or so) and send me the link.  Or you can download <a href='' onclick='externalLink(`thislink`)'>this tweak</a> that will copy some files from your MZD system to the USB drive and send those.",
    "q4": "Do I have to uninstall a tweak with AIO 1.x before installing it again?",
    "a4": "No, You can install every tweak with AIO, you never have to uninstall before. MZD-AIO-TI 2.x use the same tweaks AIO 1.x and compatability was taken into consideration.",
    "q5": "How long does the installation/uninstallation take?",
    "a5": "Up to 10 minutes if every tweak has been selected (especially custom colors and speedcam-patch). Preforming a backup of your JCI folder can also take up to 10 minutes by itself so with everything up to 20 minutes.",
    "q6": "What if I want to revert my system but I forgot the tweaks I've installed?",
    "a6": "Uninstalling tweaks is safe in general, if the uninstaller dosn't find a backup, it will copy the original files from USB drive over your original files of your MZD system BUT: YOU SHOULD NOT DO THIS FOR NEW AND UNKNOWN FW VERSIONS! See: 'Reverting' section of this help panel.",
    "q7": "I want to change the order of the audio sources?",
    "a7": "Edit: /jci/gui/apps/system/js/systemApp.js on lines 624 - 637<br><br><b>* Be careful, the last line must not end with a comma, or you run in to boot loop! *</b><br> I am working on modifying the tweak to give the option to make your own order without manually modifying any files.",
    "q8": "Can I install AIO from an SD card?",
    "a8": "No. SD card slot in the car is ONLY for satnav maps. You need to use USB port in the car, so either USB stick or USB-SD card reader with your card in it.",
    "q9": "How do I a reboot the MZD system? ",
    "a9": "Press NAV+MUTE for 10 seconds.",
    "q10": "Can you write this or that tweak for us?",
    "a10": "I have improved on many of the existing tweaks and tweaks.sh as a whole but I do have a job and Developing the GUI for this app is a pretty hefty task. That being said, I will take suggestions for future tweaks but no promises. You can contact me with the contact link on the bottom right of the app."
