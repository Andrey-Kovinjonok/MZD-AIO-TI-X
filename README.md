#### **What is 'MZD-AIO-TI'?**
My good friend @Siutsch copied files from many different tweaks for his infotainment system and thought, it would be helpful if you could choose what tweaks you wanted to install or uninstall. He went on to develop a CMD based program to accomplish this and it worked well but lacked that modern app feel and faced other limitations.  As a developer, I felt like I should upgrade AIO into a full fledged desktop app but with the same underlying tweaks that we all know from [AIO v1.5.x][1]. It was around that time I came across [Electron] and I went on to develop MZD-AIO-TI.

This Project has 2 particular aspects, user interface and the custom built installer script: **tweaks.sh** and associated files. @Siutsch and I continue to work together on that aspect to this project to optimize the tweaks.sh script for safety, efficiency, and in the future analysis.

### How to install:  
###### Download and open the setup file and it will install and start up.
- Select Desired Tweaks and Press the "Start Compilation" Button.
- Insert a blank FAT32 USB flash drive to copy files directly to the drive
- Or copy the contents of "_copy_to_usb" (created on your desktop) to the root of a blank USB flash drive.

###### Before Car Installation:
- unplug any other USB drives from the car except this flash drive.  
-
For installation of speedcam patch (see below), the NAVI SD card must remain in the car, because speedcam.txt file will be copied directly to SD card.  
- For installation of speedometer, the NAVI SD card must remain in the car too, without NAVI SD card a special patch will be installed, otherwise the compass is rotated 180 degrees.  
- In general, the SD card can remain in the car during the tweak installations.  

#### Installation Into MZD Infotainment System:
- Plugin USB drive, turn on car and wait for the "==  MZD-AIO-TI ==" window to appear (This may take 2 - 20 minutes so be patient).
- At that point you will be given the option to continue or abort the installation.
- Associated messages with pop up during installation (No further user interaction is needed).  
- The system will be restarted automatically.
- Remove the USB drive after restart.
- Tweaks will be applied upon reboot.

#### WHICH FW VERSIONS ARE SUPPORTED:

##### The tweaks can be installed for these FW versions at this time:
- 56.00.100A/230A/240B/511A/512A/513C / 59.00.326A -ADR (4A N)
- 56.00.230A/511A/512A/513B -EU
- 55.00.650A/753A/760A / 58.00.250A -NA
- 56.00.401A-JP

_**This will be generally checked at the beginning of an installation, if your FW is not compatible the installation will abort at this point.  This is for the safety of incompatible systems.**_


##### The following tweaks are checked individually during installation of tweaks.sh, because there are different (config)-files to consider:
- speedcam-patch
- pause_on_mute
- track-order/FLAC support
- no_more_disclaimer
- list_loop
- order_of_audio_source_list


##### Speedcam-patch support is only for:
- 56.00.100A/230A/240B/513C / 59.00.326A -ADR (4A N)
- 56.00.230A/511A/512A/513B -EU
- 55.00.650A/753A/760A / 58.00.250A -NA
- 56.00.401A -JP

##### For 56.00.51xX -EU / ADR there is no GPS data anymore! Use this workaround:
- After opening the doors at least wait 35 seconds, then press the start button or start the car
- Before starting the speedometer app, start the NAVI app before (and close again)
- Unplug and replug the NAV SD card (should be avoided)
##### Track-order/FLAC support only for:
- 56.00.100A/240B/513C -ADR (4A N)
- 56.00.230A/511A/512A/513B -EU
- 55.00.650A/753A/760A / 58.00.250A -NA
#### These tweaks will only install on compatible firmware vesions.

 ## **Android Auto Headunit App**
 #### V0.93A (2016-07-29) by spadival / agartner (use with google Android App)
 - http://mazda3revolution.com/forums/2014-2016-mazda-3-skyactiv-audio-electronics/121561-android-auto-headunit-app-beta.html
 - https://github.com/spadival/headunit/releases
 - https://github.com/gartnera/headunit/releases/tag/v0.91B

 1. Install Android Auto app on your phone: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.projection.gearhead or here: https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/android-auto/android-auto-1-5-100945-2462389-release-release/android-auto-1-5-100945-2462389-release-android-apk-download/
 2. Connect the phone to USB (*) and pair the phone bluetooth with the CMU
 3. Click on Android Auto under Applications Menu on the CMU
 4. A black screen with credits should open up first
 5. Android Auto will then start. If it does not, pull out the USB and start over again (or check the installation.)

 _**NOTE: If you are using USB Audio for sound, You can only connect your phone after car has started and the CMU has booted up. If anything is connected, the source ids change and the headunit app is not yet designed to handle that**_

 #### Version 0.93A Change log
 -    Working again with newer google play services

 #### Version 0.92A/B Change log
 -    When using fav key to switch to radio, track keys allow you to change between presets
 -    When exiting AA, audio automatically switches back to radio
 -    Added oppo to the vendor list

 #### Version 0.91b Change log
 -    Backup cam is no longer broken
 -    Media keys work and voice button works
 -    Press favorite key to toggle between AA audio and radio audio
 -    Press home key to quickly kill AA
 -    Some startup issues fixed

 ####   Known issues:
 -    Credits only displayed on first opening of AA
 -    Blank screen after exiting AA if backup cam was used
 -    when returning from backup cam, first frame will be static/garbage. A new gui frame needs to originate from the phone before static disappears.
 -    Phone bluetooth not functioning (disable bluetooth on car/phone)
 -    Next and previous buttons will generate two keystrokes the first time pressed

 #### TODO:
 -    fix phone
 -    use track keys to switch radio stations when in radio mode
 -    fix audio level issues (try skipping a song, then pause and press play again)

 #### Version 0.83 Change log
 1. Performance improvements via sequential operation and removal of mutex locks - provided by @agartner
 2. Changed Video sink to mfw_isink - supposed to be faster and also now opera status (volume) bar can be overlayed if required - need some javascript expertise to make it a floating bar.
 3. Hide the disclaimer/credits after 2- 3 seconds
 4. Now you can touch drag/swipe
 5. Added VID for Lenovo

 #### Version 0.7 Change log
 1. USB Audio is enabled - to actually use this, you need a separate USB thumb drive in one of the slots, as this is the only way for you to be able to select USB audio in the CMU. Please do not try to use MTP option on your android phone, as it is not going to work.. Also, you need at least one mp3 or any music file in the USB thumb drive (I used http://www.xamuel.com/blank- mp3- files/point1sec.mp3)
 2. Since there was a severe case of audio stuttering once for me, I have included an option to disable USB audio and switch back to AUX. You can do this by placing a file called hu_disable_audio_out in the SD CARD (which, of course, means you now need an SD card ). I haven't actually tested this out as USB Audio worked fine at all times except that one instance.
 3. Nexus fix provided by @agartner
 4. Debug version of the app - to be run from ssh only - download from here . Copy to /data_persist/dev/bin, chmod 755 and run after executing the following command:
 ```sh
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data_persist/dev/androidauto/custlib:/jci/lib:/jci/opera/3rdpartylibs/freetype:/usr/lib/imx-mm/audio-codec:/usr/lib/imx-mm/parser:/data_persist/dev/lib:
 ```

 #### Version 0.6 Change log
 1. Voice control should not cause app to quit
 2. More VIDs added, including a possible fix for Nexus phones with VID 0x18D1

 #### Version 0.5 Change log
 1. Voice control enabled
 2. More VIDs added, including a possible fix for Nexus phones with VID 0x18D1
 3. Graceful kill when reverse gear engaged - App will restart when reverse gear is disengaged. However, reverse camera is still dark (because same V4L device?) as app isn't killed fast enough.

 #### Version 0.4 Change log
 1. Performance improvement to the gstreamer pipeline - testing shows no issues with Nav now. However, need some feedback to check if it is the same for everyone.
